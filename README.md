Exploratory Data Analysing using Python libraries pandas, NumPy and plotly

**Step1:**
At first if you do not have a python environment and jupyter notebook then download them and setup the environment. In place of jupyter notebook, google colab can also be used. 
You can install the used library one by one by typing in the terminal
    pip install pandas==1.3.1
    pip install numpy
    pip install plotly==5.10.0
    
OR, 
you can Install all the required library in one go. download the requirements.txt file and run
  pip install -r requirements.txt

Now, you have successfully completed the environment setup part



**Step2:**
Downaload the file named as "benezDataReport.ipynb" and place the dataset that is "2022_02_08-02_30_31_AM.csv" in the same folder.
Launch jupyter notebook and open the "benezDataReport.ipynb" file.
You will get this type of interface shown in below image:

In the upside menu bar you will get a Kernal. Click on that. Some options will poped up, click on "Restart & Run All".
You will get a popup message, click "Restart and Run all Cells".
